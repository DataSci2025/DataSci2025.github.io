### [Kaggle S&P Regression Analysis] (https://github.com/DataSci2025/KaggleStocks2018)
This project utilises public data to explain stock returns. A Kaggle snapshot of S&P 500 data with a limited number of financial ratios from 2018 was employed alongside yfinance price data. OLS regressions predicted 5 snapshots of annual price returns. Overall results were weak, although positive correlations appeared with Price/Sales. For Year 1, negative correlations were also shown with momentum, an unusual combination worthy of further investigation.
